            <h2>What to do if your data does not follow normal distribution?</h2>
            
            <h3>Non-normality</h3>

            <p>
                So far we have tested normality by both graphical and statistical methods, the question is what will
                happen if the graph and statistics shows deviation from from normality.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>The first step is to know why we have deviation from normality</strong>
            </p>

            <p>
                It is important to note
                that many processes or data sets naturally fit a non-normal distribution. For example, the number of
                accidents will tend to fit a Poisson distribution and lifetimes of products usually fit a Weibull
                distribution. However, there may be times when your data is supposed to fit a normal distribution, but
                does not. For example, time taken to reach office from home data is usually supposed to fit a normal
                distribution. If you face a non-normal distribution for such data sets, it is advised to check for the
                below reasons in your data and correct if needed.
            </p>

            <ol type="i">
                <li>
                    <strong>Extreme values/ Outliers</strong> - too many extreme values in a data set will result in a
                    skewed distribution. Normality of data can be achieved by cleaning the data. This involves
                    determining measurement errors, data-entry errors and outliers, and removing them from the data for
                    valid reasons.
                    <p>
                        It is important that outliers are identified as truly special reasons (measurement errors,
                        missing data, data corruptions, or rare events).
                        In such cases, the extreme values could be identified and removed in order to make the
                        distribution more Gaussian.
                        Dealing with these extreme values may require domain expertise or consultation with a domain
                        expert in order to both design the criteria for identifying outliers and then removing them from
                        the data sample and all data samples that you or your model expect to work with in the future.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Note:</strong> The nature of normally distributed data is that a small percentage of
                        extreme values can be expected; not every outlier is caused by a special reason. Extreme values
                        should only be explained and removed from the data if there are more of them than expected under
                        normal conditions
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Subgroups / Overlap of two or more processes</strong> - data may not be normally distributed
                    because it actually comes from more than one process, operator or shift, or from a process that
                    frequently shifts. If two or more data sets that would be normally distributed on their own are
                    overlapped, data may look bimodal or multimodal – it will have two or more most-frequent values
                    (mode, mean, median - central location).
                    <p>
                        The remedial action for these situations is to determine which X’s cause bimodal or multimodal
                        distribution and then stratify the data. The data should be checked again for normality and
                        afterward the stratified processes can be worked with separatel
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Insufficient data discrimination</strong> - Round-off errors or measurement devices with
                    poor resolution/precision can make truly continuous and normally distributed data look discrete and
                    non-normal.
                    <p>
                        The remedial action for this situation is, we should use a more accurate measurement system or
                        should collect more data points to overcome insufficient data discrimination or an insufficient
                        number of different values.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Smaller sample size</strong> - One common reason that a data sample is non-Gaussian is
                    because the size of the data sample is too small. For example, if you look at distribution of the
                    height of 50 students in a particular class, you will see that it follows a normal distribution.
                    However, if you randomly chose just three students from the same class, it may follow a uniform
                    distribution. Or a skewed distribution as well depending on which students you choose.
                    <p>
                        Many statistical methods were developed where data was scarce. Hence, the minimum number of
                        samples for many methods may be as low as 20 or 30 observations.

                        Nevertheless, given the noise in your data, you may not see the familiar bell-shape or fail
                        normality tests with a modest number of samples, such as 50 or 70.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The remedial action for this situation is, we you can collect more data. Thanks to the law of
                        large numbers, the more data that you collect, the more likely your data will be able to used to
                        describe the underlying population distribution.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Sort data/ Resolutionted data</strong> - Data collected from a normally distributed process
                    can also fit a non-normal distribution if it represents just a sample / subset of the total output
                    of the process. This happens when we sort the data before analysing it (example, configuration of
                    the mechanism making the observation, data is passing through a quality-control process, resolution
                    of the database used to store the data).
                    <p>
                        Suppose there is a ring manufacturing process where the target is to produce rings with a
                        diameter of 10 CM. The USL and LSL are 10.25 CM and 9.75 CM respectively. If the ring diameter
                        data were collected from such a process and all values outside the specification limits were
                        removed, it will show a non-normal distribution (uniform distribution), even though the data
                        collected will originally be normally distributed.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The remedial action for this situation is to increase resolution. That is, instead of keeping
                        data in a predefined range, allow you data to spread as much as the process is.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Values close to zero or a natural limit</strong> - If a process has many values close to
                    zero or close to a natural process boundary, the data distribution will skew to the right or left.
                    <p>
                        The remedial action for this situation is, a transformation, such as the Box-Cox power
                        transformation, may help make data normal. In this method, all data is raised, or transformed,
                        to a certain exponent, indicated by a Lambda value. When we compare transformed data, we should
                        transform everything under comparison in the same way.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Take note:</strong> None of the transformation methods provide a guarantee of a normal
                        distribution. Always check with a probability plot to determine whether normal distribution can
                        be assumed after transformation.
                    </p>

            </ol>
            <p>
                <strong>If the non-normality is not caused by these above reasons</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Data follows different distribution</strong> - In addition to above-mentioned reasons where a
                normally distributed process data can show as non-normal, there are many data types, which follow a
                non-normal distribution by nature. In such cases, you should analyse the data using the tesdo not assume
                normality.

                    <strong class="special">In such cases, you have three options</strong>
                </p>
                <li>
                    <strong>Run parametric test</strong> - You may still be able to run the parametric tests if your sample size is large enough (usually over 20 items). By the law of large numbers, you may assume normality.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Transform distribution/ Normalize</strong> - You can also choose to transform the data with a function, forcing it to fit a normal model. Three common data transformations are reciprocal transformation, log transformation, and square-root transformation. There is no guarantee that a specific transformation will ensure your data meets the assumption of normality, so it is worth conducting several transformations on your data.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Run non-parametric test</strong> -  If you have a very small sample, a sample that is skewed, or does not meet the assumption of equal variance, or one that naturally fits another distribution type, you may want to run a non parametric test.
