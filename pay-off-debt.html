            <img src="wed-img/debt-repayment-img.PNG" alt="">
            <p class="quote">
                <span class="main-quote">“Some debts are fun when you are acquiring them, but none are fun when you set
                    about retiring them.”</span>
                – Ogden Nash
            </p>
            <p>
                If you’re one of the many Kenyans struggling to manage debt, you aren’t alone. Prices and interest rates
                alike are high, and it can feel difficult to get out from under payments. Whether you are paying off
                credit cards, student loans or other kinds of debt, figuring out a plan can cause immense money stress.
            </p>
            <p>
                Paying off debt isn’t impossible though, even when funds are tight. Budgeting carefully, making
                strategic payments and negotiating terms are all strategies you can employ to pay off your debts faster.
            </p>

                <h3>Why is it important to repay your debt?</h3>
                <p>
                    There are many reasons why you need to settle your debt. The benefits range from psychological
                    relief to financial prosperity. Here are a brief:
                </p>
                <ol type="i">
                    <li>
                        <span class="where-invest">
                            Less stress, improved health
                        </span> - It’s no surprise that owing a large amount of money causes psychological strain, but
                        did you know that debt is ranked as one of the most stress-inducing life events?
                        <p>
                            According to research by Kenyan psychological Centre, 2024, 47 percent of respondents who
                            reported that money has a negative impact on their mental health said that debt is their top
                            area of concern.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Therefore, as you are working on improving your mental health, planning your finance and
                            paying your dues on time plays a crucial role.
                        </p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <span class="where-invest">
                            Improve your credit score
                        </span> - Your credit score acts as a summary of your creditworthiness. A low credit score can
                        make it hard for you to qualify for additional financing or prevent you from receiving favorable
                        loan terms and rates. Without financing it can be difficult or impossible to purchase big ticket
                        items such as a home or vehicle.
                        <p>
                            Therefore, when you have a good credit score, you will be able to find financing when you
                            need. This is also important to find a bettter interest rate as banks are checking your
                            credit scores to set an interest rate for your financing. Am I helping you to clear your
                            debt just to help you get into another? Absolutely no, but incase you need, and it is
                            extremely important, you can access financing with a lower interest.
                        </p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <span class="where-invest">
                            Make money management easier
                        </span> - If a large portion of your income is going toward monthly debt payments, you may
                        struggle with covering you basic needs including rent, and medical bills.
                        <p>
                            Therefore, try to clear your debt as fast as possible because you don't know about tomorrow.
                            There are the risks of inflation, jobloss, permanent disability or even death.
                        </p>

                            Save money on interest fees
                        </span> - Credit cards in particular can take a huge bite out of your wallet in the form of
                        interest charges. The longer you carry a balance on a credit card, the more you’ll end up paying
                        in interest. In fact, the compounding interest on credit cards makes them exceptionally
                        difficult for many borrowers to pay off. Paying off your credit card balances can save you
                        serious money in the long run. In most cases you can save significant funds by paying off your
                        car loan or mortgage early as well. Just be sure to check the fine print on your loan agreement
                        to be sure you won’t face a pre-payment penalty.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <span class="where-invest">
                            Build your wealth
                        </span> - The less money you’re paying in interest fees, the more money you’ll have to put
                        towards your savings goals such as retirement, college tuition, a down payment, or a dream
                        vacation. Whatever your financial objectives, reducing your overall debt can go a long way
                        toward helping you achieve them.

                            Say no to other debt

                        stick to it. Live below your means. You may also consider closing your credit card or atleast do
                        not carry it around.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <span class="where-invest">
                            Understand your debt
                        </span> - Get a spreadsheet or a piece of paper and pencil to jot dow the details of all your
                        dues. Whom do you owe? What is the balance if you are to pay today? What is the interest rate?
                        What is the minimum monthly repayment? When is the loan due?

                            Lower the interest rate
                        </span> - repay your credit card dues over the 0% period. Make your billing 100% within the 0%
                        period. Here you will save a lot. You may also renegotiate loan term with the bank and reduce
                        loan period to lower the interest rate. Another option is, refinance loan by going to the
                        competitor financial institution where the interest rates are lower.

                        a second job or side hustle. A small amount of income that is put towards repaying the loan will
                        get a long way in reducing your loan significantly.

                        Go through your monthly expenses, jym subscription, insurance, streaming services, eat outs; ask
                        yourself if you can get rid of some and put extra cents in repaying the debts.

                        cleared a loan, of course without taking an extra loan. Let say you are paying a short term
                        emergency loan with kes 2,000 per month and a student loan kes 4,000 per month. After clearing
                        the emergency loan, commit the kes 2,000 for repaying the student loan making a total monthly repayment kes 6,000.

                            Another question comes here is which loan to repay first? logically, repaying the loan with
                            higher interest rate is to be repaid first to reduce interest cost. Emotionally, repaying
                            smaller loan is rewarding as you will feel accomplishment and motivated to clear other loans.
                            I think humans are more of emotions than logic, look for what works for you.

                    Debt payoff can be a long, tedious journey, but the psychological and financial rewards of doing so will benefit
                    you in the long run. The most important thing to remember on this journey is that you have plenty of
                    options and resources at your disposal.

                    Make sure you’re aware of every alternative repayment option, debt payoff calculator and financial
                    tool (like a balance transfer credit card or a debt consolidation loan) at your fingertips. Once you
                    know your options, stay consistent and remember the long-term goal at hand to set yourself up for
                    steady financial footing in the future. Allow me to
                    conclude with the sayings from
