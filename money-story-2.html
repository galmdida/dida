            <h3>Earning, spending and saving</h3>
            <div id="blog">
                <p>
                    Iâ€™ve heard many people wonder if your spending habits truly make a difference, or is it the income
                    that matters. I believe it is sum of both. hiseâ€™s a story about a true saver and spender and what
                    exactly happens when you change your spending habits.

                    The story you are about to read is true. The names have been changed to protect those involved.
                    (Note Sarcasm ðŸ˜‰ )
                </p>
                <h3>Once upon a time there were two brothers.</h3>
                <p>One was named Guyo and the other Dida.</p>
                <p>
                    Guyo and Dida were raised by two hardworking, frugal minded parents. These wonderful parents
                    raised the brothers to understand the importance of saving money, spending wisely, and budgeting.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Guyo and Dida both began receiving an allowance at age 12. They were both given the same amount
                    of
                    money and were taught to save at least 10%, tithe 10% and the rest they could spend.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Dida began small chicken farm at a young age. The majority of his weekends and summers were spent at
                    the
                    farm. He was able to earn a good deal of money from this job and he
                    followed his parents counsel by saving and tithing 10% of his income.
                </p>

                <h3>The Teen Years</h3>
                <p>
                    As Dida grew, so did his social life. He loved to spend his weekends with friends. He enjoyed
                    using his spending money, and because He had saved and tithed, He felt no guilt in spending the
                    rest. Dida and his friends spent the majority of their time together going to movies, eating out
                    at restaurants, and shopping at the mall.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At age 18 Dida got a job. This job provided him with part time hours during the school year and
                    full time during the holidays. He was earning more money now, and was diligent about saving money and
                    preparing for his financial future. Dida was very proud of his bank account, and proud that He
                    had been able to save faithfully during his teen years.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>When he graduated from high school he had Kes 300,000 in his savings account.</strong>
                </p>

                <h3>Guyo</h3>
                <p>
                    Unlike Dida, Guyo didnâ€™t own a farm during his younger years. He tried to do extra chores
                    around the home and was able to earn some extra money that way.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At age 18 Guyo began working at the same store Dida had worked at. Guyo was also able to earn a
                    steady income with part time hours during the school year and full time during the holidays.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Guyo worked hard at his high school job and enjoyed earning money. He was diligent about tithing
                    10% of his paychecks, but decided to save even more than the 10% his parents had asked of his.
                    Instead, he saved 70% or more of each paycheck and kept very little for personal spending money.
                </p>

                <p>
                    His social life grew, as most teens did. He chose his friends wisely, and found friends who had
                    similar goals and aspirations as he did. Instead of going to movies and shopping, like Dida and
                    his friends did, they instead chose to spend time at each othis homes and enjoying frugal activities
                    together.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>
                        Guyo graduated from high school with Kes 1,600,000 in his banking account. (Remember Dida
                        only had Kes 300,000)
                    </strong>
                </p>
                <h3>So What Happened?</h3>
                <p>
                    Two brothers. Raised the exact same way. Given the exact same allowance. Worked at the exact same
                    job, received the exact same paychecks. Yet, Guyo ended up with four times the amount of money that
                    Dida had.
                </p>
                <h3>The difference?</h3>
                <p>
                    Guyo was much wiser in his spending. He chose to participate in frugal activities and understood
                    the value in saving as much money as he could.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Dida, on the other hand, did the bare minimum. He didnâ€™t worry much about the future, and
                    figured as long as He was saving a little bit, he would be fine. Dida didnâ€™t realize the life
                    He COULD have given himself if he had only practiced a little more self control. his vision was
                    not as big as Guyo's.
                </p>
                <h3>Spending Habits Matter</h3>
                <p>
                    All good stories end with a moral, and this one is no different.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The story of Guyo and Dida has taught me many many financial lessons. However, this is one
                    lesson that sticks out to me more than the others.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Guyo and Dida received the EXACT same paychecks, for the EXACT same number of years. Their
                    parents taught them the EXACT same money principles in the EXACT same way. But, Guyo chose to save
                    and save and save, while Dida chose to spend.
                </p>

                <p>
                    This teaches me that our financial situation is not always about how much money we might MAKEâ€¦.it is
                    more about how much money we SAVE. The paycheck isnâ€™t the problem, the way we spend money is the
                    problem.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Just imagine what a difference your savings account could make over the next few years if you just
                    cut out going out to eat, or going to the movies, etc. Little baby steps can make a big difference.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I am able to say this, because this is MY story. I am Dida.
                </p>

                <h3>20 Years Laterâ€¦.</h3>
                <p>
                    It has now been 20 years since Guyo and Dida grew up together learning how to manage money.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Guyo Update: Guyo continues to save money, live frugally and budget. He has found a good balance
                    between spending money to enjoy life and saving for emergencies and the future.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Dida Update: It took a little bit longer for Dida to learn smart money skills. But, through
                    time and a few financial hardships, he is now a diligent budgeter and loves to save money. He also
                    writes a little blog called Finance Wednesday where he shares that living on a budget can still be
                    a sweet and happy life! ðŸ˜‰
