            <h2>Normality Test in Python</h2>
            <p>
                <strong>Normality test</strong> is statistical technique used to determine whether a sample data has
                been drawn from a normally distributed population.
                It is an important part of descriptive statistics. Before reporting any statistics such as mean, or
                conducting statistical test such as correlation, t-test, ANOVA, or regression, normality test is
                paramount. If the data does not follow normal distribution or has an outlier, reporting mean might be
                misleading as it is sensitive to outliers. If the assumption of normality is not met, the results will
                be invalid for tests that assume normality and therefore non-parametric alternatives were adopted.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Normal distribution,</strong> also known as Gaussian distribution, is the most important
                statistical probability distribution for independent random variables. Most researchers will recognize
                it as the familiar bell-shaped curve present in statistical reports. Normal distributions are
                appropriate for continuous variables. It is a probability distribution that is symmetric about the mean,
                i.e., the right side is a mirror image of the left side, indicating that the data near the mean occur
                more frequently than those at a distance from the mean. The area under the normal distribution curve
                represents the probability, and the total area under the curve sums up to one. In a perfectly normal
                distribution, the mean, median, and mode values are the same, and they indicate the peak of the curve.
            </p>
            <h3>Methods of testing normality</h3>
            <p>
                There are several techniques for checking the normality of the dataset. These techniques can be
                described into two broad categories:
            </p>
            <ol type="i">
                <li>
                    <strong>Graphical tests</strong> - These are methods for plotting the data and qualitatively
                    evaluating whether the data looks Gaussian. This method is very subjective an thus calls for
                    statistical test if the distribution is not clear.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Statistical tests</strong> - These are methods that calculate statistics on the data and
                    quantify how likely it is that the data was drawn from a Gaussian distribution.
                </li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Let's start with graphical test</h3>
            <p class="intro">Here we are going to look at three common graphical test for normality</p>
            <ol type="i">
                <li>
                    <strong>Histogram</strong> - commonly used plot to quickly check the distribution of a sample of
                    data.

                    In the histogram, the data is divided into a pre-specified number of groups called bins. The data is
                    then sorted into each bin and the count of the number of observations in each bin is retained.

                    The plot shows the bins across the x-axis maintaining their ordinal relationship, and the count in
                    each bin on the y-axis.

                    A sample of data has a Gaussian distribution if the histogram plot is showing the familiar bell
                    shape. This can further be visualized using gaussian distribution density curve.

                    A histogram can be created using the matplotlib function in Python which by default estimates the
                    number of bins from the data sample.

                    See the code snippet for drawing histogram to test the normality of selected numerical variables in
                    our data.

                    <strong>Box Plot</strong> - or boxplot (also known as a box and whisker plot) is a type of chart
                    often used in explanatory data analysis. Box plots visually show the distribution of numerical data
                    and skewness by displaying the data quartiles (or percentiles) and averages.

                    Box plots show the five-number summary of a set of data: including the minimum score, first (lower)
                    quartile, median, third (upper) quartile, and maximum score.

                    When the median is in the middle of the box, and the whiskers are about the same on both sides of
                    the box, then the distribution is symmetric. And data is normally distributed.

                    When the median is closer to the bottom of the box, and if the whisker is shorter on the lower end
                    of the box, then the distribution is positively skewed (skewed right). This means there are more
                    data points above the median.

                    When the median is closer to the top of the box, and if the whisker is shorter on the upper end of
                    the box, then the distribution is negatively skewed (skewed left). This means there are more data
                    points below the median.

                    <strong>Quantile-Quantile Plot</strong> - Q-Q plot, or QQ plot for short.

                    This plot generates its own sample of the idealized distribution that we are comparing with, in this
                    case the Gaussian distribution. The idealized samples are divided into groups (e.g. 5), called
                    quantiles. Each data point in the sample is paired with a similar member from the idealized
                    distribution at the same cumulative distribution.

                    The resulting points are plotted as a scatter plot with the idealized value on the x-axis and the
                    data sample on the y-axis.

                    A perfect match for the distribution will be shown by a line of dots on a 45-degree angle from the
                    bottom left of the plot to the top right. Often a line is drawn on the plot to help make this
                    expectation clear. Deviations by the dots from the line shows a deviation from the expected
                    distribution.

                    <strong>Shapiro-Wilk test</strong> - evaluates a data sample and quantifies how likely it is that
                    the data was drawn from a Gaussian distribution, named for Samuel Shapiro and Martin Wilk.

                    In practice, the Shapiro-Wilk test is believed to be a reliable test of normality, although there is
                    some suggestion that the test may be suitable for smaller samples of data, e.g. thousands of

                    <strong>Anderson-Darling test</strong> - is a statistical test that can be used to evaluate whether
                    a data sample comes from one of among many known data samples, named for Theodore Anderson and
                    Donald Darling.

                    It can be used to check whether a data sample is normal. The test is a modified version of a more
                    sophisticated nonparametric goodness-of-fit statistical test called the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test.

                    A feature of the Anderson-Darling test is that it returns a list of critical values rather than a
                    single p-value. This can provide the basis for a more thorough interpretation of the result.

                    The anderson() SciPy function implements the Anderson-Darling test. It takes as parameters the data
                    sample and the name of the distribution to test it against. By default, the test will check against
                    the Gaussian distribution (dist=’norm’).

                    See the code snippet for calculating statistics and p-value to test the normality of selected
                    numerical variables in
                    our data.

                    <strong>D’Agostino’s K-squared test </strong> - It is based on D’Agostino and Pearson’s [1], [2]
                    test that combines skew and kurtosis to produce an omnibus test of normality. In Python,
                    scipy.stats.normaltest is used to test this. It gives the statistic which is s^2 + k^2, where s is
                    the z-score returned by skew test and k is the z-score returned by kurtosis test and p-value, i.e.,
                    2-sided chi squared probability for the hypothesis test. After using alpha value of 0.05, below
                    results were found. The null hypothesis is rejected for all the variables suggesting that all the
                    variables are not normally distributed. As in graphical analysis, “Height” variable was looking
                    normal, here “Height” variable too is showing p-value 0 suggesting the variable is not normally
                    distributed.

                    <strong>Jarque-Bera test</strong> - This tests whether the sample has the skewness and kurtosis
                    matching with a normal distribution, i.e., skewness=0 and kurtosis =3. The null hypothesis is same
                    as D’Agostino’s K-squared test. The test statistic is always nonnegative, and if it is far from zero
                    then it shows the data do not have a normal distribution. This test only works for more than 2000
                    data samples. In Python, scipy.stats.jarque_bera is used for the test. Below we can see that all
                    variables’ test statistics is far from zero and p-values are 0 suggesting that all variables are not
                    normally distributed.
